# hw_03_password_generator
This is a project in which I recieved an existing HTML and CSS file that was functional, however was tasked with editing an existiing java script file to be able to create a randomly generated password based on specifications from the user.

# Installation

I pulled the files from Github from the gt-atl-fsf-ft-08-2020 repo. From there I copied the files from assets which included the existing index.html, script.js and style.css which were used for editing purposes. The files were edited using VS CODE. Finally the code was submitted to the hw-03-password-generator on my Git Hub profile.

# Usage
The refactored files have the same functionality as the intial code, however have been reformatted so that it is more distinguishable.
